# Airplane-Boarding
This is a little simulation i'm making for different methods of boarding airplanes, I want to do a real timed experiment using random values and specific boarding methods to prove which one is the best!

I got the idea for this project here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAHbLRjF0vo

I will eventually try to build some sort of GUI for it, probably with something like pygame, but for right now it works with CLI.
